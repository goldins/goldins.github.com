<p>I found a community on reddit called redditgetsdrawn where people post photos of themselves and other users draw them. I had a go at one:</p>
<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/reddit_sanderjim.jpg" alt="sanderjim" class="img-left"/>

<p>Original:</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/h34VT8g.jpg" alt="sanderjim original" class="img-left"/>

<p>I thought it was fairly successful. I will probably do more in the future, maybe even without grid lines!</p>
