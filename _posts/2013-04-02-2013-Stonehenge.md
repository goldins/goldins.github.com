<p>I've sketched a few things since the last update. Here's one of them!</p>
<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/standing_stones_sm.jpg" alt="Stonehenge sketch" class="img-left"/>
<p>It is a copy of an old etching. I found the original <a href="http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/pages/standing-stones.php" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
