<p>Here's a copy of the Alice in Chains - Black Gives Way to Blue <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Gives-Way-To-Blue/dp/B0029LHW4U" target="_blank">album cover</a>. Confession: I traced the outline, and I am sorry. It did not occur to me at the time to use a drawing grid.</p>

<p>Thoughts: Maybe I should make a referral account on Amazon? Real thoughts: It was difficult to keep proportions consistent. You can probably see (many) areas where my sketch does not match the original. I may use a drawing grid next time. Besides that, I liked the way it turned out.</p>
<p>Meta: I replaced my (now defunct) twitter link with an "about" page. Read it if you'd like.</p>
