<p>That last exercise was fun so I decided to repeat it. In celebration of my upcoming trip to Seattle, WA, I drew my left hand about to flip a 2007 Washington quarter. I used the same process of converting a pure contour drawing into a sketch. I am not sure if it's good or bad, but I noticed I was referencing my hand much more than the contour sketch.</p>

<p>Self Critique: The part of the hand under the thumb seems too big. I don't know if this is because my hand actually looks like that, the shading, or just an incorrect outline. I may come back to this and fix it. Of course, I will keep this here for posterity's sake.</p>
