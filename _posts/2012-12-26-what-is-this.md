<p>Hello and welcome to my long-dormant personal website. For brief information about me, please see the big "About" link above. For an even more brief synopsis, keep reading.</p>
<p>I am a full-time web developer pursuing (or, perhaps more aptly, wandering in) a more creative direction. I have always enjoyed art and design but, believing that it cannot be taught, never learned how to create it correctly.</p>
<p>The future of this website will (hopefully) catalogue and track my journey from development to design.</p>
