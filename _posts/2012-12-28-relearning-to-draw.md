<p>I ordered the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585429201">Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</a> and from what I understand, I will be a professional artist in a few days.</p>
<p>It seems like the book focuses on "learning to see", which I have heard time and again. In truth, the book does seem to have that "as-seen-on-TV", pseudo-science vibe to it ("Anyone can draw! Read this book to learn how!") but I am willing to try.</p>
<p>What I am trying to get out of this is a new, hopefully unique and efficient, method of self-expression. Just as having a vocabulary is essential for verbal communication and thought, having an ability to draw is required for visual communication. Furthermore, this book claims to "unlock" a mode of thinking that is beneficial to many occupations and day-to-day life, so why not at least try?</p>
