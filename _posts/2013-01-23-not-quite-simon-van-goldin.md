<p> In the latest chapter (Chapter 7 - Perceiving Spaces, for those following along), I was instructed to, at least at first, draw only the <i>negative spaces</i>. Drawing a chair was a new challange and I found myself drawing the horizontal bars more than I should have ("are the two bars the same width?" etc). Presumably because the bars were going away from me, and I was at times stuck on them, the angles in the negative spaces were sometimes difficult to determine. As such, my sketch came out a bit uneven. Take a look:

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/chair_comparison_sm.jpg" alt="chair comparison" class="img-left"/>
</p>
<p>Also, I <a href="http://www.gimp.org" alt="gimp.org"/>Gimp</a>ed up an overlay.<br/>
<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/chair_overlay_sm.jpg" alt="chair overlay" class="img-left"/>
</p>
<p>I did not get the chance to re-do my hand/quarter sketch and now I also want to re-sketch this chair. I will try to make time! Thanks for reading.</p>
