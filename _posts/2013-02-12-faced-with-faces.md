<p>After a few practice skull sketches and some instruction about proportions in faces, my task was to sketch a copy of John Singer Sargent's profile portrait of Mme. Pierre Gautreau. Both are below.</p>
<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/madame_x_sm.jpg" alt="Madame X copy sketch" class="img-left"/>
<p>As far as proportions and feature placement goes, I think I did well. Some details (hair, etc) were a bit off, but that only acts as a safeguard against implications of forgery.</p>
