<p>I signed up for a skillshare class: <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/Comic-Art-Introduction-to-Penciling-for-Comics/520032677/" target="_blank">Comic Art: Introduction to Penciling for Comics</a>. The first "homework" assignment was to draw a main character, supporting character, and villian.</p>
<p>Limbo is a young adult missing an arm (story here? probably), but content with his life. Roombo is the entity of a decomissioned robot and his broken Roomba. The android's legs are missing, and the Roomba's wheels are broken, so they help each other out.</p>

<p>I am still working out a villian.</p>
