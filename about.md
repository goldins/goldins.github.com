<p>Welcome! This is my personal website. I am a NYC-based web developer who is broadening his skillset by experimenting with photography and art. At the surface, I want to try something new and creative. At the core, I am exploring what I can gain from new interdisciplinary territory. I try to update this blog with sketches regularly.</p>

<p>If you would like to send me a note, please do so at [my first name][my last name][at]gmail.com (sorry, spambots, not you).</p>
